# Expense Tracker
Expense Tracker allows a user keep track of personal expenses

#Description
Expense Tracker is an application I developed to demonstrate Test Driven Development in Rails for the Boston Ruby Beginner's Study Group.

The application is developed in an iterative and incremental manner.  The GIT repository contains a series of branches that show different stages of the development process.  Branches exist that show each of the phases of the Red-Green-Refactor cycle

#Iterations
##Iteration 0
Set up a bare bones rails project to use rspec.  Rspec is configured to display colors and provide the documentation output.

The database is postgres, but that can be changed if needed.
